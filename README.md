Diary about boostcamp AI Tech 

This repository works for only saving records for studying.

Each folder of which name is meaning the date when I studied saved diary(some folders have python, matlab, c++ code).

**Notice**

Briefly, now I moved the entire diary to the [Notion](https://www.notion.so/ko-kr/product?utm_source=google&utm_campaign=10805039169&utm_medium=104440699897&utm_content=455555244437&utm_term=notion&targetid=kwd-312974742&gclid=CjwKCAiA866PBhAYEiwANkIneLrmf_y7OS3aO1_AiQavgoc__cN2toFT3GeTpCnH4OC2yH-t5hDrNRoClnIQAvD_BwE).

This repository will upload the original markdown draft of each diaries, as I did before.

Nothing will be changed, but I recommand seeing the diaries in the notion. It will be clear.
